🐍 Colorful Snake (Java)

This project is an enhanced version of the classic Snake game, built in Java with colorful visuals and infinite screen wrapping. The game demonstrates real-time rendering, collision detection, and object-oriented design principles using Swing/AWT.

🎮 Features

Dynamic Colors: Snake body segments randomly change colors as it moves.

Smooth Controls: Arrow keys provide responsive movement.

Food & Growth: Snake grows longer each time food is eaten.

Infinite Wrapping: The snake seamlessly reappears from the opposite side of the screen instead of colliding with borders.

Self-Collision Detection: The game ends only when the snake collides with itself.

Score Tracking: Score updates as food is eaten and displays on both the play screen and game-over screen.

Organized Codebase: Clear class structure for rendering, input, and game logic.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Java (JDK 21+)

Swing / AWT for rendering graphics and UI

javax.swing.Timer for real-time game loop updates

Keyboard event listeners for input

🚀 Running the Game

📚 Learning Outcomes

Through building Colorful-Snake, I practiced:

Implementing game loops and real-time updates with Swing timers.

Managing self-collision detection and infinite screen wrapping.

Using object-oriented programming for modular, maintainable code.

Enhancing visuals with dynamic colors and score display.
